These instructions are for setting up the portion of the LQ2 NTuple Analyzer
which uses the Higgs Combine package to run limit setting on an LQ Analysis 
using a set of input datacards. 

The Higgs Combine package has further documentation at:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit


1) Check out the package. If you haven't already: 

      cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8
      cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src
      cmsenv
      rehash
      cvs co -d NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit UserCode/baumgartel/LQ/NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit
      cvs co -r V01-12-03 HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
      scramv1 b -j 16
      rehash
      scramv1 b -j 16      
      combine --help

   You should see all of the options for the combine facility.
   

2) Set up the data-card information for all the LQ Masses/channels. 

   The combine facility runs on input datacards, and the limit calculations are
   based one one-line commands using those input datacards. For many masses/channels
   it is useful to organize everything and have a short python script which 
   submits to batch and gathers the output. In this step we will organize all the
   input datacards. 
   
   Ultimately we will use a python script to facilitate all this, so let's keep all
   the data-card information in a single text file called 'FinalCards.txt'.
   
   Model this after an example at: NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/FinalCards_Example.txt
   
   Each card in the text file will start with a name like 'LQ_BetaHalf_M_250.txt' or 'LQ_M_250.txt'. 
   Keep these name conventions as such changing only the mass values. 
   
   The rest of the card structure is documented at: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit
   I summarize briefly:
   
    The channel info first ....
    * imax 1  - number of channels  (1 for our single channel analyses)
    * jmax 5  - number of backgrounds
    * kmax 13  - number of nuisance parameters, including statistical uncertainties for each channel
    
    The infor on the processes (signal and backgrounds ... )
    * bin  1 1 1 1 1 1 -  identifies the channel the process belongs to (only 1 channel for now...)
    * observation 431 - number of observed events in data passing selection
    * process LQ_BetaHalf_M_250 DiBoson ....  - name for our processes we wil list
    * process 0 1 2 3 4 5 - An integer index for each process
    * rate ... tells the expected yield of events in the specified bin and process 
   
    The nuisance parameter info
    
    e.g. jet energy scale: 
    * Jes  lnN  1.049 ... - The name (Jes) and the integration (lnN=lognormal) and 1 + fractional uncertainty. 
    
    
    
	If statistics are low, for statistical uncertainties you can use gamma-function (gmM) integration, and would list
	* name gmM (number MC events)  weight_1 weight_2 weight_3 weight_4 ...
	
	
	Important note on correlations:
	
	If systematics are listed on the same row as (1+fractional uncertainty), they are considered correlated. Hence all 
	our JES systematics are full correlated. 
	Systematics on different rows are uncorrelated, hence JES and MES are uncorrelated, and all statistical uncertainties
	are uncorrelated. 
    

3) Run the batching tool. Once you have a 'FinalCards.txt' you are happy with, you can run the batching tool 

   a) Use the batch mode launching with:

	  cd NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/

      python RunStatsBasicCLs.py --do_BetaOne --do_BetaHalf -q 8nh -n 2 -c MyFirstRun

      About the options:
      
      --do_BetaOne               :  Specifies to do beta=1 channel
      --do_BetaHalf              :  Specifies to do beta=1/2 channel
      --do_Combo                 :  Specifies to do combination of beta=1 and beta=1/2 channels
      -q 8nh                     :  Specifies batch queue '8nh'
      -c MyFirstRun              :  Specifies the output log files and castor directories of root files will be
                                    labeled "StandardExample". Choose whatever name you want. 
      -n 2                       :  2 jobs per mass point per channel per cross-section test
      --castor_only              :  This will copy root files only to castor, not locally.
                                    * Use this if you don't have at least 200MB
                                      free space in your working area for root
                                      files *   
      --Asymptotic_Only          : Specifies not to run the full batch calcualtion of CLs, but just to use
                                   the fast Asymptotic CLs method. Results will print to screen. Roughly 10 mins
                                   for single channels and upwards of an hour for combination. Asymptotic results
                                   also print to screen by default when using batch mode, this just turns of batch.                     
                     
                                      
    b) What does the script do? 
    
       - It Looks at FinalCards.txt and splits up all the cards for each channel/mass. 
       - It uses a quick method (Asymptotic CLs) to estimate the range of possible cross-sections to scan.
       - It splits up everything into many jobs and launches them. 
       - Resulting root files are copied to castor and locally for step (5)
       
    c) Why "-n 2"? Doesn't CLs require many many jobs? 
    
       Yes, it does. This is 2 jobs for each mass/channel for each test-cross-section. 
       
       The asymptotic CLs predicts the range of cross-section to scan. That range in then increased a bit and 
       split into an array of test points. Then there are 2 jobs per test point. This is mainly to fit into the
       8nh queue. 
       
4) Wait for jobs to finish and then gather results.

    All the CLs jobs have finished and are saved into your castor directory in a folder called CLsLimits/MyFirstRun 
    (or whatever your -c Name was as a python input). 
    
    These root files contain all the toy information, and will be used to calculate limits. This is automated with 
    another pythong script. So check that your castor directories are full, and run once for each channel:
    
    e.g. Locally
           python AnalyzerDirectoryForCLs.py /castor/cern.ch/user/d/darinb/CLSLimits/BetaOneMyFirstRun/ 
           python AnalyzerDirectoryForCLs.py /castor/cern.ch/user/d/darinb/CLSLimits/BetaHalfMyFirstRun/ --betahalf

    e.g. With Castor

           python AnalyzerDirectoryForCLs.py CLSLimits/BetaOneMyFirstRun/ 
           python AnalyzerDirectoryForCLs.py CLSLimits/BetaHalfMyFirstRun/ --betahalf           
   
   This will give an array of cross-section limit that you can copy and paste into your standard plot macros.

5) Make the Single Channel Plots. 

   Step (4) Should have given you some C++ arrays. These can be inserted in a couple standard plot macros. 
   
   In the plots, you can replace the relevant arrays around line 240. 
   
   For Muon Channel:

       NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/BR_Sigma_MuMu_vsMass.C
       NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/BR_Sigma_MuNu_vsMass.C

   For the Electron channels:
       NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/BR_Sigma_EE_vsMass.C
       NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/BR_Sigma_ENu_vsMass.C       
       
    Of course, edit the legends/labels as needed, but the theory curve etc should be good for our 2011 mass points.
    
    
    
6) Channel combination jobs

   a) Use the batch mode launching with:

	  cd NTupleAnalyzerV2/tools/HiggsLimit/SingleChannel/

      python RunStatsBasicCLs.py --do_Combo -q 8nh -n 1 -c MyFirstComboRun
       
       
   b) Or just use Asymptotic CLS with multiple jobs:
   
      python AsympBatcher.py --do_Combo -q 8nh -n 1 -c JunkTest --castor_only --Asymptotic_Only
      
      ... Wait for jobs to complete.
      
      python AsympmBatcherParser.py 
      
7) Gather Combination Results

    NEW: QUICK RESULTS WITH ASYMPTOTIC CLS

##################################################################

0) Follow steps (1) and (2) of the normal method above to set up the working area and make your FinalCards.txt

1) Put your normal "FinalCards.txt" in the SingleChanel directory and run the individual channel limits with:

    python RunStatsBasicCLs.py --do_BetaOne --do_BetaHalf -q 8nh -n 2 -c DummyTag  --castor_only --Asymptotic_Only
       
	Results will print to screen.
	
2) You can also run the Combination asymptotically. Every beta value takes about as long as step (1), and 
   it's good to use many beta values. So a quick fix is to batch this. 
   
   A) First run the script that submits the jobs to batch. This will fill text files of results into a newly created 
      "BatcherResults" directory.   
   
       python AsympBatcher.py --do_Combo -q 8nh -n 1 -c DummyTag --castor_only --Asymptotic_Only

   B) Then run the additional script to scan the contents of the "BatcherResults" directory. Results output to screen.
  
       python AsympBatcherParser.py
